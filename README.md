# Christmas Cocktails

Creating festive cocktails for family and friends is a fun little tradition of mine.
Last year, I designed a simple printed menu, but this year, I wanted to take it up a notch by creating an online cocktail menu with a snowfall effect. 
To make it even more accessible, the menu can be viewed via a QR code.
